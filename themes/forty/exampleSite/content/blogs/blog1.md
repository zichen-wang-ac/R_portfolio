Hi, welcome to the R analytic world of Zichen.

I am **Zichen WANG**, from Beijing, China.

I recently graduated from ESSEC Business School and currently study at London Business School. I turned from Bachelor of Business Administration major to Masters in Analytics and Management. 

Data Analytics will be my new focal point of life.

I just began my adventure on data analytics. There's still a long story to tell you about how I got here(and a even longer story about where I will go).

If you are interested in my stories, find me and let's chat ;).
