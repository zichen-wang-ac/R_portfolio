> From viewing the graphs above, it is clear that geography affects the level of of consumption of wine, beer and spirits. In the top 25 beer and wine consuming countries, European countries are predominantly present. In contrast, spirits are more diverse with Asian countries such as Thailand, Japan, China and even Oceania making an appearance from the Cook Islands. 
>
> This could be due to both culture and climate of each country. Consumption seems to follow production. France, famously known for its wide variety of wine production, unsurprisingly is the top consumer of wine. Other countries that host favorable climate and cultures are also present near the top of the list- from Portugal to Italy. Furthermore, this trend is repeated in the consumption of beer with Germany and Ireland near the top of the list. Oktoberfest and Guinness, two respective cultural hallmarks of each country understandably explains this trend. 
>
> In contrast, spirits are more diverse, reflecting the variety of methods to create them from Russian potatoes to sugar cane in the Caribbean. The range between the top 25 beer drinking countries is far lower than both wine and in particular Grenada vs. other countries. This could show that people have less polarized taste to beer compared to wine and spirits.

> To determine whether there is a relationship between number of facebook likes the cast of a movie receives and the gross earnings of that movie, we plot the data as below -

  NULL

# Alpha of 0.2 is used to see where there is a cluster of data points on the plot. As there are a few outliers, the x variable of Cast Facebook Likes is restricted from 0 to 200,000.

```

> Examining the plot, we can conclude that that Cast Facebook Likes is not a good predictor of gross movie revenue. There is no clear trend with a varying amount of movie revenue earned per amount of Facebook Cast Likes. 

> Let's see if another variable portrays better correlation with gross revenue.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
# creating a scatter plot for budget and gross revenue 
ggplot(data = movies, mapping = aes(x = budget, y = gross)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Gross Earnings and Budget ", x = "Budget", y = "Gross") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  NULL
```

> As seen in the plot above, budget is a better indicator to determine gross revenue for each movie, however it is far from being a perfect indicator. For each budget value, there is a wide spread of values for gross revenue. However, it is clear that with a low budget, a movie is likely to have low gross revenue. 

> Let us also check if ratings are a good indicator of gross revenue a movie earns.

```{r, gross_on_rating}
# plotting ratings and gross earnings of movies faceted by genre
movies %>% 
ggplot(data = movies, mapping = aes(x = rating, y = gross)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +

  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  NULL
```

> As seen above there are varying relationships developed for IMDB rating and gross revenue for each genre.

> Genres that have the largest data such as action, comedy and drama show that as ratings increase, there is more gross revenue. Action in particular highlights this relationship. However there are a few genres with limited data points where no relationship can be established such as Musical, Romance, Thriller and Western.

> We think this such correlation and lack of data points also has something to do with the popularity of each genre. In less popular genres such as Documentary, irrespective of the ratings, the gross earnings remain more or less constant. In more popular genres such as Action and Adventure, higher ratings are relatively more correlated with earnings.

  labs(title = "Monthly Return Density Plot", x = "Monthly Return", y = "Frequency") +
  NULL
```

> As seen from the above plot, Twitter (TWTR) is the riskiest as it has the greatest variance in monthly return. The least risky is the S&P 500 (SPY) as the monthly returns have less variance. This is as predicted due to the nature of an ETF being a consolidation of other stocks and therefore it will have less inherent risk.

> We also create a Risk vs Return plot for expected monthly returns on each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
# plotting risk on x axis and expected monthly return on y axis
ggplot(data = summary_monthly_returns, mapping = aes( x = sd_return, y = mean_return)) +

  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes( x = sd_return, y = mean_return, label = symbol)) +
NULL
```

> From the above plot it is clear that some companies have more return per given amount of risk. Overall, both CitiGroup (C) and Twitter (TWTR) have relatively high risk compared to the modest level of returns they offer. 
A risk-averse investor would prefer Boeing (BA) in comparison to CitiGroup (C) as it is slightly less risky and offers nearly 3 times more (expected) returns. Similarly, between Twitter (TWTR) and Diageo (DEO) both of which have approximately the same amount of expected returns, a risk-averse investor would prefer Diageo as it is relatively risk-free.

> The above plots highlight relationships between different variables in the dataset hr_cleaned.

> As seen in the dataset, the data provided from IBM shows an attrition rate of around 16%, indicating 84% of employees remained with the firm. 

> The variables of 'age', 'years at company', 'monthly income' and 'years since last promotion' are further analyzed to understand their distribution. The summary statistics alone can give us a good indication on if the distribution is not normal. However, it is hard to assert if the distribution is normal only from this data. In this case, by looking at the summary data the distributions of years at company / income / years since last promotion were not normal. However, to understand if age was a normal distribution, a histogram plot was required.

> Job satisfaction and work life balance were two variables that had distinct descriptive values. Plotting the distribution of job satisfaction showed that roughly two thirds of employees either had high or very high levels of job satisfaction. Just over one third had either medium or low levels of job satisfaction. Work life balance was far more fairly distributed with around three fifths of all employees stating they had better levels of work life balance and only one fifth claiming either the best or the worst work life balances. 

> Other variables of gender, job role and education level all influence the difference in income level for employees. The dataset shows that with a higher education status and job position, the employee is likely to have a larger monthly income. Females are seen to have a slightly larger median monthly income compared to males. A general trend of higher age correlates to higher income, which is reflected in all positions in the firm.

# Details

- Who did you collaborate with:
Alessandro Angeletti, Zichen Wang, Johanna Jeffery, Nitya Chopra and Christopher Lewis
- Approximately how much time did you spend on this problem set:
Approximately 15h
- What, if anything, gave you the most trouble:
1. Figuring out when to use "color" and when to use "colour"; and
2. The difference between "==" and "%in%".
