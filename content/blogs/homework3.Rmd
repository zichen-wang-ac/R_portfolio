# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the YRBSS survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. We will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

Let's load and inspect the data first. 

```{r}
# loading and inspecting data
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. 
Before we carry on with our analysis, let's check `skimr::skim()` for any missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and rough histograms.

```{r}

skimr::skim(yrbss)

# use this to understand what all the columns are
??yrbss
```

From the above, we can conclude that all 13 variables have a lot of missing values

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}

# filtering out missing weight values
weight_data <- yrbss %>% 
                filter(weight!="NA")

# plot to see distribution of weight               
weight_plot <- ggplot(weight_data, mapping=aes(x=weight)) +
                geom_density() +
                theme_bw() +
                theme(
                  plot.title=element_text(face="bold")
                ) +
                labs(
                  title = "Distribution of Weight",
                  subtitle = "Density plot of participants' weights",
                  x = "weight (in kilograms)",
                  y=""
                ) +
                NULL

weight_plot

# summary stats for weight distribution
summary(weight_data$weight)
                
```
> The data for weight is missing for 1004 survey respondents. We have filtered them out before plotting the density plot above. 
> The distribution is skewed to the right as median weight (64.4 kgs) is less than the mean weight (67.9 kgs). It is so because we have one outlier (max weight = 181 kgs) pulling the average up. 

Let us try to identify how level of physical activity affects a high schooler's weight. We'll create a rough plot quickly to visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

``` {r}

# plotting weight vs physical activity
exercise_weight_plot <- ggplot(weight_data, aes(x=weight, y=physically_active_7d)) +
                        geom_point(alpha=0.8, size=0.5) +
                        theme_bw() +
                        theme(
                          plot.title = element_text(face="bold")
                        ) +
                        labs(
                          title = "Trends in Physical Activity Levels and Weight",
                          x = "Weight",
                          y = "Level of Physical Activity"
                        ) +
                        scale_y_discrete(limits=c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)) # change discrete values on y axis

exercise_weight_plot


```
> One would expect a correlation between level of physical activity and weight of a person - higher physical activity should ideally imply a lower (read: healthier) weight, however, according to our data that is not the case. There seems to be roughly the same kind of distribution of weights across all physical activity levels i.e. irrespective of how active a set of people has been in the last 7 days, their weights are identical to another set which hasn't been as active. 

Next, let us create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}

# adding a new variable to measure physical activity levels
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(
    physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no")
    ) 

yrbss_stats <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%          # getting rid of null values 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%                # grouping by 'yes' or 'no'
  summarise(count = n()) %>%                  # counting rows in each category
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))              # calculating proportion of each category

yrbss_stats

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schoolers that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

``` {r}

# assigning values for p hat and size of population
p_hat_not_active <- yrbss_stats$prop[1] 
size <- sum(yrbss_stats$count)
t_crit <- qt(0.975, size - 1)
  
# calculating se and mean
se_not_active <- sqrt(p_hat_not_active*(1-p_hat_not_active)/size)
mean_not_active <- se_not_active/sqrt(size)

# calculating confidence intervals

lower_ci_not_active <- mean_not_active - t_crit*se_not_active
upper_ci_not_active <- mean_not_active + t_crit*se_not_active

paste("95% confidence interval for high schoolers who are NOT active for 3 or more days per week is: ", round(lower_ci_not_active, 6), ",", round(upper_ci_not_active,6))


```

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}

yrbss_boxplot <- yrbss %>% 
                  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus), !is.na(weight)) %>%
                  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=physical_3plus)) +
                  geom_boxplot() +
                  theme_bw() +
                  theme(
                    plot.title = element_text(face="bold")
                  ) +
                  labs(
                    title = "Relationship between physical activity and weight",
                    y = "physical activity level category",
                    x = "weight (in kgs)"
                  ) +
                  NULL

yrbss_boxplot

# summary stats for "yes"
summary_yes <- yrbss %>% 
          filter(!is.na(physical_3plus), !is.na(weight), physical_3plus=="yes") %>%
          summarise (median_weight=median(weight), mean_weight=mean(weight))
summary_yes

# summary stats for "no"
summary_no <- yrbss %>% 
          filter(!is.na(physical_3plus), !is.na(weight), physical_3plus=="no") %>%
          summarise (median_weight=median(weight), mean_weight=mean(weight))
summary_no
        
                

```
> The boxplots are a little surprising as one would expect them to be the other way round i.e. people who are more physically active ('yes' or 3+ days a week) should have a lower median weight compared to people who are less active physically ('no' or < 3 days a week)
> One possible reason why this might be the case is that a lower weight does not necessarily mean a high schooler is healthier or more active. Other factors such as age, dietary habits, amount of sleep, etc could be influencing weight to a greater extent.  

## Confidence Interval

The boxplots above show how the medians of the two distributions compare, however we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. 

```{r}

# creating confidence interval for mean weight in two categories
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), #use na.rm to ignore missing values
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```
> There is an observed difference of roughly 1.7 kg (68.4 - 66.7) in the mean weights, and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. 

It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. So let us also conduct a hypothesis test to verify this.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Null Hypothesis (Ho) : mean weight for those who exercise at least 3 times a week is the same as mean weight for those who don't exercise as frequently

Alternative Hypothesis (H1) : mean weights are different for those who exercise at least 3 times a week and those who donâ€™t

```{r}
# to get rid of scientific notations
options(scipen=999)

# hypothesis test
ttest <- t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
ttest

# to view the different components/ stats under t.test
names(ttest)

# extract the statistic needed
ttest$p.value


```

> since the p-value is very low (significantly less than 5%), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the difference of 1.7kgs between the means of both samples wasn't just by chance or sampling error. 

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will use a new function, `hypothesize`, which falls into the 'infer' workflow to conduct a hypothesis test.

```{r}
# initialising the test
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no")) # statistic is difference in means with order yes - no != 0

obs_diff
```

After we have initialized the test, we need to simulate the test on the null distribution.

```{r}

# saving null distribution
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%  
  # here hypothesize is used to set null hypothesis as a test for independence i.e. no difference b/w two population means
  # in case on 1 sample, we can set null = "point" to test hypothesis relative to a point estimate
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% # type is set to permute; argument used when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

null_dist

```

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}

#plot null distribution
null_visualised <- ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()

null_visualised

```
Next, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

#visualise the null distribution
visualize(null_dist, bins = 10) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction="both")

# extract p value
null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "both")

```
> since p-value is ~0, the null hypothesis is rejected.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))

comparison_data <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  select(c(director, title, rating)) %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating),
            count = n(),
            se = sd/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se,
            lower = mean - t_critical * se,
            upper = mean + t_critical * se
            )

comparison_data

# data_for_comparison <- movies %>% 
#   filter(director %in% "Tim Burton") %>%

data_plot <- comparison_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(color = c("#00bfc4", "#f8766d"))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(
                    y = reorder(director, mean),
                    xmin = lower, 
                    xmax = upper),
                size = 2,
                width = .05
                ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean, y = director), size = 4) +
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27,
            xmax = 7.33,
            ymin = 0,
            ymax = 100,
            alpha = .7,
            fill = "#c8c8c8",
            color = "#c8c8c8"
            ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "",
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Do Spielberg adn Burton haev the same mean IMBD ratings?",
    subtitle = "95% confidence interval overlap",
    x = "Mean IMBD Rating",
    y = ""
  ) +
  annotate("text", x = 6.93, y = 1.1, size = 8, label = "6.93") +
  annotate("text", x = 6.53, y = 1.1, size = 5, label = "6.53") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.33, y = 1.1, size = 5, label = "7.33") +

  annotate("text", x = 7.87, y = 2.1, size = 5, label = "7.87")

data_plot

```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r}
#H0: Spielberg's and Burton's means are statistically similar
#Ha: Spielberg's and Burton's means are statistically dissimilar
#We can also write this as:
#H0: mu_s - mu_b = 0
#Ha: mu_s - mu_b != 0 

tests <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  group_by(director)

ttest <- t.test(rating ~ director, data = tests, var.equal = TRUE)
ttest

null_disttrib <- tests %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) 

null_disttrib

mean_diff <- tests %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))
mean_diff

visualise(null_disttrib, bins = 10) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff, direction = "right")

null_disttrib %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff, direction = "right")

# Since our p-values are smaller than our alpha of 5%, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
# Therefore, Spielberg's mean IMBD rating is statistically different from Burton's IMBD rating
```


# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame

```


## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval
omega_gender_ci <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            sd_salary = sd(salary),
            sample_size = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, sample_size-1),
            se_salary = sd(salary)/sqrt(sample_size),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_salary,
            salary_low = mean_salary - margin_of_error,
            salary_high = mean_salary + margin_of_error
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_salary))
omega_gender_ci

set.seed(1234)
female_boot_salary <- omega %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  specify(response = salary) %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

set.seed(1234)
male_boot_salary <- omega %>% 
  filter(gender == "male") %>% 
  specify(response = salary) %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

female_percentile_ci <- female_boot_salary %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
female_percentile_ci

male_percentile_ci <- male_boot_salary %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
male_percentile_ci

# correlation analysis
salary_plot <- omega %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = salary, y = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "On Average, Men earn more than Women", subtitle = "Box Plot of Salary Earnings by Gender") + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 9), 
    plot.title = element_text(size = 17)) +labs(x = "Salary", y = "Gender")

salary_plot
```



> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

ttest <- t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)
ttest
# 95% confidence interval does not include 0, therefore must reject the null hypothesis
# hypothesis testing using infer package


salary_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("male", "female"))
salary_in_null_world

visualise(salary_in_null_world, bins = 10) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = ttest$stderr, direction = "right")



```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(data = omega, aes( x = experience, y = salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(reshape2)

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

UN_data_clean <-  UN_GDP_data %>%
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName %in% "Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)"~ "Agriculture",
    IndicatorName %in% "Changes in inventories"~ "Inventories",
    IndicatorName %in% "Construction (ISIC F)" ~ "Construction",
    IndicatorName %in% "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",

    IndicatorName %in% "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)" ~ "Transport",
    IndicatorName %in% "Other Activities (ISIC J-P)" ~ "Other",
    IndicatorName %in% "Total Value Added" ~ "TVA",
  )) %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      names_to = "Years",
      values_to = "Monies",
      cols = -c(CountryID, Country, IndicatorName)
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Monies = Monies/10^9,
    )

UN_data_clean

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data <- UN_data_clean

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

selected_GDP_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list)

selected_GDP_data
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)

yr  <- as.Date(as.character(selected_GDP_data$Years), format = "%Y")

gdp_plot <- selected_GDP_data %>%
  mutate(Years = year(yr)) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c("Gross_capital", "Exports", "Government", "Household", "Imports")) %>%
  group_by(IndicatorName) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(Years, Monies, group = IndicatorName, color = IndicatorName)) +
    facet_grid(~ Country) +  
    labs(
      color = "Components of GDP",
      title = "GDP components over time",
      subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
      y = "Billion US$",
      x = ""
      ) +
    scale_x_continuous(
      breaks = seq(min(selected_GDP_data$Years), max(selected_GDP_data$Years), by = 10)
    ) +
    theme_bw() +
    NULL
  

selected_GDP_data
gdp_plot
  
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r}

gdp_computation <- selected_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c("Consumption", "Gross_capital", "Government", "Imports", "Exports")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = IndicatorName,
    values_from = Monies
    ) %>% 
  mutate(GDP = (Consumption + Gross_capital + Government + (Exports - Imports)))

gdp_computation

```

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(scales)

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)

tidy_gdp_wide <- UN_data_clean %>%

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

> This chart outlines the composition of the three nations GDP's and how these have changed over the past five decades.
> Germany's GDP compotosition hasn't dramatically changed over the past decade, however, what we do see is how since the 2000's its Net Exports have increased in importance (thus Exports exceeded Imports).
> On the other hand, the United States GDP compositions have followed clear trends. For instance, government expenditure has decreased over time, a decrease which has been made up primarly by an increase in household expenditure. The government increasing 'laiser faire' approch of might explain this decrease. Notably, net exports have decreased (thus America has been importing more than it has been exporting), thus increasing its dependancy on its trade partners.
> Finally, India has seen a dramatic change in its GDP composition. Despite net exports and government expenditure remaining quasi unchanged, gross capital formation has almost doubled, with household expenditure decreasing by ~20%. This increase in Gross capital is largely attributed to India's efforts of the 21st centry to develop its national infrastructure.
