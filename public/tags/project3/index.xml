      <description>About This project is part of the second group homework of Applied Statistics with R taught by Professor Kostis Christodoulou at London Business School.
My collaborators are Alessandro Angeletti, Nitya Chopra, Johanna Jeffery, and Christopher Lewis. (Hail Group 13!)
The project utilizes the following datasets:
 Life expectancy at birth GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ Female fertility: The number of babies per woman Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births HIV prevalence (The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49)   Letâ€™s do this Before we start to analyze the data, we must first retrieve the data.</description>
